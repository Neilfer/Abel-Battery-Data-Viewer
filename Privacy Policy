Welcome to Abel Battery Data Viewer !

This app is only used for viewing data for your own battery-backup/ inverter/ solar system. 

Therefor there are no private info that you enter into the app, as well as no personal info that I save.

The only things that I save on a database is your username you create to login, it can be any username (so it is not private info such as a cellphone number or email),
your password that you create which is encrypted on the database so I can not see your password.

But again, this app is only to view your battery info, you can not send info back to your system. So no one can hack you and change settings on you battery back or inverter.

If you have any doubts or questions, contact me on email.
